# AI Textbook Generator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Generated Content
Generate a complete, fully structured textbook using AI, where all book content must be produced chapter-wise with lessons, headings, examples, and exercises, following clean academic formatting.

### II. Structured Academic Content
All book content must be produced chapter-wise with lessons, headings, examples, and exercises, following clean academic formatting.

### III. Docusaurus Compatibility
The book must be compatible with Docusaurus Markdown format.

### IV. Custom Frontend
Provide all code required for a custom frontend (not the default Daurus theme).

### V. Integrated Toolchain
Integrating everything using Spec-Kit Plus, Gemini/Claude Code, and GitHub Pages deployment.

### VI. Clean File Structure
Provide a clean file structure under /book/ including /chapters/, /components/, /layouts/, and /docs/.

## Development Workflow

The development workflow will follow the Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology, using Spec-Kit Plus to manage the process. This includes stages for specification, planning, tasks, implementation (red/green/refactor), and explainers.

## Governance

This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles. All development artifacts, including specifications, plans, and code, must adhere to it. Amendments require a formal proposal and review process.
